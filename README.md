# Neural Network Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:  

The purpose of this project was to introduce us to the Neural Networks and TensorFlow. Using TensorFlow and Python together, we were able to build a neural network that predicts the success of donations made to charity. 

## Results: 

- ### Data Preprocessing: 

    - I first started out by dropping "EIN" and "NAME" from our DataFrame.
